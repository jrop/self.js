Create self-extracting Node.JS packages.

Self.js works by creating a self-extracting Node.JS script (it embeds the output of `npm pack`).  Later, when a user runs this script, it will unpack itself and execute.

For example, say your package has the following shape:
```
your-package/
	package.json
	index.js
```

You then create a self-extracting script from this package:

```sh
$ self.js (path to your-package) > my-package.js
```

Later when a user executes `my-package.js`, it will extract like:

```
my-package.js
node_modules/
	your-package/
	...other dependencies...
```

Done!

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install --global self.js
# or
$ yarn global add self.js
```
